Reality-based status assessment for accurate planning

📋 NEXT PRIORITIES
According to your Implementation Checklist Phase 1 Week 1 goals:
Immediate (This Week):

ActionButtons SSOT Compliance - Critical for template creation
TranslationInput Enhancement - Replace basic textarea with full component
Performance Optimization - Achieve consistent <3s AI responses

Quality Gate Status:

✅ Real AI Integration (working)
✅ Progressive Features (now fixed)
🔄 SSOT Compliance (~55% - needs component updates)
⚠️ Performance (inconsistent - needs optimization)

The fixes I've provided should resolve your immediate frustrations and get you back on track with your Implementation Checklist goals. Would you like me to tackle the ActionButtons SSOT compliance next, or focus on the performance optimization?
