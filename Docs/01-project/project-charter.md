# AIdioma Project Charter
## Spanish Learning Platform - Vision & Mission

---

## üéØ **Project Vision**

**AIdioma** is an AI-powered Spanish learning platform that combines personalized translation practice, interactive reading, and intelligent conversation practice to accelerate language acquisition through modular, reusable components.

### **Core Value Proposition**
- **Personalized Learning**: AI adapts to individual skill level and learning pace
- **Real-world Practice**: Sentence translation, text reading, and conversation practice
- **Intelligent Feedback**: Contextual hints and detailed evaluation explanations
- **Gamified Progress**: Points, streaks, achievements, and level progression
- **Cost-Effective AI**: 85-90% cost reduction through intelligent caching

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Philosophy**

### **Modular-First Design**
- **12 Core Modules** provide all functionality
- **6 Pages** compose modules in different combinations
- **Cross-page reusability** - same modules power multiple experiences
- **Independent development** - modules can be built and tested separately
- **Standardized APIs** - consistent integration patterns

### **Technology Principles**
- **TypeScript-first** development with strict type safety
- **Component-driven** UI with shadcn/ui design system
- **Performance-optimized** with intelligent caching strategies
- **Mobile-responsive** with touch-friendly interactions
- **Accessibility-compliant** following WCAG guidelines
