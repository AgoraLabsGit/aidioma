## ðŸŽ¯ **How These Documents Work Together**

```
Project Charter â†’ MVP Features â†’ Implementation Roadmap
     â†“               â†“                 â†“
  Vision &        Detailed          Week-by-week
  Strategy      Requirements         Execution
```

1. **Charter** establishes the "why" and "what" at a high level
2. **MVP Features** defines the "what" in detailed technical terms  
3. **Roadmap** plans the "how" and "when" for execution

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Insights**

### **Modular Architecture is Central**
Every project document emphasizes AIdioma's modular design philosophy:
- 12 core modules power 6 different pages
- Cross-page reusability reduces development time
- Independent module development enables parallel work
- Standardized APIs ensure consistent integration

### **Cost Optimization is Critical**
AI cost reduction through intelligent caching is a core requirement:
- 85-90% cost reduction target through 3-tier caching
- Performance requirements: <500ms AI response times
- Business viability depends on cost-effective AI usage

### **User Experience Drives Design**
All features are designed around learning effectiveness:
- Progressive hints promote independence over dependency
- Gamification maintains motivation and engagement
- Real-world practice builds practical language skills
- Personalized learning adapts to individual progress
