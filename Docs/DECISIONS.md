Lexicon decisions retained below.

## D-014 — Spanish dictionary source: Kaikki Wiktextract
Date: 2026-08-07 · Phase: — · From: R-001 · Affects: [SPEC-F-LEXICON, SPEC-A-CONTENT]
Chose: Kaikki eswiktionary Wiktextract JSONL over FreeDict, WordNet, FreeLing, RAE
Why: Only downloadable structured Spanish-first senses; open license; curated extract under content pipelines
Revisit if: CC-BY-SA blocks commercial shipping, or product requires licensed RAE-grade monolingual prose

## D-015 — Kaikki is editorial; DeepL is runtime MT
Date: 2026-08-07 · Phase: — · From: R-002 · Affects: [SPEC-F-LEXICON, SPEC-A-CONTENT]
Chose: Keep frozen Lexicon posture — Kaikki offline QA/seed only; DeepL for later Translation/AI fallback; maps own lesson/collection binding
Why: Different jobs; Kaikki has no stable sense ids or phrase/curriculum authority; Lexicon already uses `lex-*` + contextual maps
Revisit if: A measured import pipeline publishes reviewed Kaikki candidates into `content/lexicon/` with receipt schema
