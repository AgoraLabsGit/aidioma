# Practice Page - Implementation Tasks & Issues
*Updated based on comprehensive Anthropic audit findings*

## **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED (Aligned with Updated Roadmap)**

### **Progressive Hints System (20% â†’ 95% target)**
- [ ] **Implement Real 3-Level System**: Currently only has basic fallback templates, needs full implementation
  - [ ] Level 1 (Basic): Contextual Spanish learning hints
  - [ ] Level 2 (Intermediate): More specific grammar/vocabulary guidance  
  - [ ] Level 3 (Complete): Detailed translation assistance
- [ ] **Add Hint Advancement UI**: Visual level indicators and progression controls
- [ ] **Fix Hint Request Behavior**: Remove automatic hint popups, make request-based only

### **Spanish Context AI (30% â†’ 95% target)**
- [ ] **Replace Generic Responses**: Current "daily conversation" fallbacks with Spanish learning context
- [ ] **Implement Spanish-Specific Prompts**: Article/verb/noun detection and contextual analysis
- [ ] **Add Grammar Pattern Recognition**: Spanish sentence structure awareness

### **Session Management**
- [ ] **Session Persistence**: Progress state updates even if user didn't answer or left input blank
  - **Question**: Is this intended behavior or should progress only advance on correct answers?

### **Component Compliance Issues**
- [ ] **ActionButtons**: Wrong icon types (Up/Down vs Left/Right), wrong sizing per SSOT
- [ ] **TranslationInput**: Missing evaluation feedback, character counter, proper states
- [ ] **SessionStats**: Completely missing, using custom progress bars instead
- [ ] **Touch Targets**: Some buttons below 44px minimum (WCAG AA violation)
- [ ] **Design Tokens**: Custom colors instead of design system tokens

### **AI Integration Completion (60% â†’ 95% target)**
- [ ] **Remove Math.random() Fallbacks**: Still present in some word evaluation components
- [ ] **Replace Hardcoded Hint Strings**: Current progressive hints use static fallback text
- [ ] **Optimize Universal AI Service**: Achieve consistent <2s response times (currently 3+ seconds)
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Improve fallback behavior when AI services are unavailable

## **ðŸ“± Testing Priorities**

### **Immediate Testing Needed**
1. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Test across device sizes
2. **Error Scenarios** - Disconnect network, stop server  
3. **Progressive Hints** - Verify 3-level hint system works
4. **Performance** - Measure and optimize AI response times
5. **SSOT Compliance** - Verify components match specifications

### **Development Questions** 
- [ ] **Session Progress Logic**: Should progress advance without correct answers?
- [ ] **Word Hints**: Should be contextual Spanish translations, not generic advice?
- [ ] **Performance Standards**: Target confirmed as <2s for all AI responses (3+ seconds not acceptable)

## **ðŸ“Š AUDIT ALIGNMENT SUMMARY**
*These tasks now align with the corrected Master-Roadmap.md based on July 2025 code audit findings:*
- **Reality Gap Identified**: Documentation claimed features "COMPLETED" that were 20-30% functional
- **Progressive Hints**: Major implementation gap discovered (documented 95%, actually 20%)
- **Spanish Context**: Generic AI responses instead of Spanish learning focus (documented 95%, actually 30%)
- **Performance**: Inconsistent response times discovered (3+ seconds vs 2s target)

## **ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria**
- [ ] All word clicks provide contextual Spanish hints
- [ ] Progressive hints work with 3 distinct levels  
- [ ] Consistent <3s AI response times
- [ ] Mobile responsive across all screen sizes
- [ ] Graceful error handling with retry functionality
- [ ] Clear session progress logic (with/without correct answers)
- [ ] **SSOT Compliance**: All components match design system specifications
- [ ] **No Mock Data**: All AI interactions use real Universal AI Service
