# UI Tasks - Incomplete & Untested Items

## **ðŸ”§ Priority Issues to Fix**

### **Word-Level Functionality**
- [ ] **Progressive Hints**: Currently shows one generic hint, should show 3 levels of increasing specificity
- [ ] **Word Click Feedback**: Generic "daily conversation" response instead of contextual Spanish hints
- [ ] **AI Performance**: Sometimes takes 3+ seconds to load (should be <3s consistently)

### **Session Management**
- [ ] **Session Persistence**: Progress state updates even if user didn't answer or left input blank
  - **Question**: Is this intended behavior or should progress only advance on correct answers?

### **Untested Features** 
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile/desktop for layout breaks
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Test offline/network disconnection scenarios  
- [ ] **Server Error Recovery**: Test server shutdown/restart scenarios
- [ ] **Network Issues**: Verify retry button appears with specific error messages

## **ðŸ“± Testing Priorities**

### **Immediate Testing Needed**
1. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Test across device sizes
2. **Error Scenarios** - Disconnect network, stop server
3. **Progressive Hints** - Verify 3-level hint system works
4. **Performance** - Measure and optimize AI response times

### **Development Questions** 
- [ ] **Session Progress Logic**: Should progress advance without correct answers?
- [ ] **Word Hints**: Should be contextual Spanish translations, not generic advice?
- [ ] **Performance Standards**: Is 3+ seconds acceptable for complex AI responses?

## **ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria**
- [ ] All word clicks provide contextual Spanish hints
- [ ] Progressive hints work with 3 distinct levels
- [ ] Consistent <3s AI response times
- [ ] Mobile responsive across all screen sizes
- [ ] Graceful error handling with retry functionality
- [ ] Clear session progress logic (with/without correct answers)
