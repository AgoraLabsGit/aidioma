## File Migration Plan

### Current → New Structure

```
Current Files                           →  New Location
development-roadmap.md                  →  02-development/roadmap.md
ai-protocols.md                         →  02-development/ai-protocols.md
spanish-app-documentation.md            →  01-project/overview.md + 01-project/features.md
spanish-app-styling-guide.md            →  03-design/styling-guide.md
```

### New Files to Create

```
docs/README.md                          # Main documentation index
01-project/architecture.md              # Technical architecture overview
02-development/getting-started.md       # Quick start for new developers
02-development/api-documentation.md     # API endpoint documentation
02-development/database-schema.md       # Database structure documentation
03-design/ui-ux-guidelines.md           # Extract UI/UX from styling guide
04-learning-system/language-data-framework.md  # From our language framework discussion
04-learning-system/progressive-hints-system.md # From our hints system discussion
04-learning-system/scoring-system.md    # From our 0-10 scoring discussion
```

# Spanish Learning App Documentation

## Quick Navigation

### 🚀 Getting Started
- [Project Overview](01-project/overview.md)
- [Quick Start Guide](02-development/getting-started.md)
- [Development Protocols](02-development/ai-protocols.md)

### 📋 Project Documentation
- [Core Features](01-project/features.md)
- [System Architecture](01-project/architecture.md)
- [Development Roadmap](02-development/roadmap.md)

### 🎨 Design & User Experience
- [UI/UX Guidelines](03-design/ui-ux-guidelines.md)
- [Styling Guide](03-design/styling-guide.md)

### 🧠 Learning System
- [Language Data Framework](04-learning-system/language-data-framework.md)
- [Progressive Hints System](04-learning-system/progressive-hints-system.md)
- [Scoring System](04-learning-system/scoring-system.md)

### 💻 Implementation
- [API Documentation](02-development/api-documentation.md)
- [Database Schema](02-development/database-schema.md)
- [Frontend Components](05-implementation/frontend-components.md)

### 🔧 Operations
- [Deployment Guide](06-operations/deployment.md)
- [Troubleshooting](06-operations/troubleshooting.md)

## For Local Development

When referencing this documentation:
- Use the numbered prefixes (01-, 02-, etc.) to understand information hierarchy
- Check the README.md for quick navigation to specific topics
- Refer to 04-learning-system/ for educational logic and algorithms
- Check 02-development/ for implementation guidance
- Use 03-design/ for UI/UX consistency
```

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create New Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p docs/{01-project,02-development,03-design,04-learning-system,05-implementation,06-operations}
```

### Step 2: Create Main README
Create `docs/README.md` with the navigation template above.

### Step 3: Migrate Existing Files
```bash
# Move and rename existing files
mv docs/development-roadmap.md docs/02-development/roadmap.md
mv docs/ai-protocols.md docs/02-development/ai-protocols.md
mv docs/spanish-app-styling-guide.md docs/03-design/styling-guide.md

# Split spanish-app-documentation.md into:
# - docs/01-project/overview.md (project overview section)
# - docs/01-project/features.md (core features section)
```

### Step 4: Create New Documentation Files
Based on our discussions, create:
- `04-learning-system/language-data-framework.md` (from our language organization framework)
- `04-learning-system/progressive-hints-system.md` (from our hints system)
- `04-learning-system/scoring-system.md` (from our 0-10 scoring system)

### Step 5: Add Implementation Guides
- `02-development/api-documentation.md` (document all API endpoints)
- `02-development/database-schema.md` (complete database structure)
- `05-implementation/frontend-components.md` (React component library)

## Benefits of This Structure

### 🎯 For Developers
- **Logical grouping**: Related information is co-located
- **Progressive detail**: From overview to implementation specifics
- **Easy navigation**: Numbered prefixes show information hierarchy
- **Role-based access**: Designers focus on 03-design/, developers on 02-development/

### 🤖 For Local Development
- **Clear context**: Each directory focuses on a specific aspect of development
- **Easy navigation**: Numbered structure guides logical information flow
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All aspects from design to deployment covered
- **Specific guidance**: Clear file references for specific topics
- **Implementation focus**: Separate implementation guides from design docs

### 📈 For Project Growth
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new files within existing categories
- **Maintainable**: Related documentation stays together
- **Searchable**: Clear naming makes finding information easier
- **Professional**: Industry-standard documentation organization

### 🔍 Quick Reference Examples
- Need UI consistency? → `03-design/styling-guide.md`
- Implementing hints? → `04-learning-system/progressive-hints-system.md`
- Setting up development? → `02-development/getting-started.md`
- Understanding scoring? → `04-learning-system/scoring-system.md`
- API integration? → `02-development/api-documentation.md`

This structure makes your documentation much more navigable and provides clear context for helping with specific aspects of your project!
