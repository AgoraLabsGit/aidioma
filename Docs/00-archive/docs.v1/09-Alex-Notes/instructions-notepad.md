ðŸ“„ Missing Documents in Order of Importance
Based on the current project state and upcoming Phase 1 implementation, here are the missing documents prioritized:

High Priority (Needed for Phase 1)
05-implementation/ai-integration.md

Critical for AI cost optimization implementation
Should document OpenAI integration patterns, error handling, caching strategies
Needed immediately for Phase 1 AI optimization work
05-implementation/testing-guidelines.md

Essential for maintaining code quality during rapid development
Should cover unit testing, integration testing, and E2E testing strategies
Critical before major database schema changes
Medium Priority (Needed for Phase 2-3)
04-learning-system/adaptive-learning.md

Important for Week 5's adaptive content selection
Should document difficulty adjustment algorithms and personalization logic
Needed before implementing adaptive features
03-design/user-flows.md

Important for UI/UX consistency as features expand
Should document learning paths, navigation patterns, and user journeys
Needed before major UI enhancements in Week 6
06-operations/monitoring.md

Essential for production readiness and performance tracking
Should cover application metrics, error tracking, and user analytics
Needed before scaling in Phase 4
Lower Priority (Needed for Production)
03-design/accessibility.md

Important for inclusive design and compliance
Should document WCAG 2.1 requirements and implementation guidelines
Can be developed alongside UI enhancements
06-operations/maintenance.md

Necessary for long-term sustainability
Should cover regular maintenance tasks, dependency updates, and backup procedures
Can be developed as system matures
ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation
Start with ai-integration.md and testing-guidelines.md as they're immediately needed for Phase 1 implementation success. These documents will provide critical guidance for the upcoming database enhancement and AI optimization work.
